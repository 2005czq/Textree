## 🤔 Why Textree?

Manually writing nested LaTeX code with `\left\{`, `\right.`, and `\begin{aligned}` to create tree diagrams is tedious, error-prone, and frustrating. Textree was built to solve this exact problem.

It allows you to focus on your content and structure using simple indentation, and instantly get clean, beautiful, and ready-to-use LaTeX code. It's the perfect tool for students, teachers, and researchers who need professional-looking diagrams without the headache.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Navigate to the [Textree Live Demo](https://2005czq.github.io/Textree/).
2. Type your hierarchical text in the input box on the left, using the `Tab` key to denote levels.
3. Click the "Convert to LaTeX" button. The live preview and the generated code will appear on the right.
4. Copy the code and paste it into your LaTeX editor!

## 🏺 History

Textree began as a personal C++ command-line tool to escape the tedious task of handwriting nested LaTeX code. To make it accessible to everyone, it was completely rewritten as the lightweight, cross-platform web tool you see today.

The original C++ prototype, a Unix-style command-line utility, is preserved in the `_archive` folder for those interested in the project's evolution.
